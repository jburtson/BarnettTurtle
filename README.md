# BarnettTurtle
The goal here is to use the classic programming exercise of turtles to draw a graphical representation of any number based on it's prime factors. The method is based on the number visualization of kid genius Jacob "Jake" Barnett.

Project also uses some code from an existing github project made by someone else, which gives most of the "turtle" functionality: https://github.com/PaulkaToast/Turtles
